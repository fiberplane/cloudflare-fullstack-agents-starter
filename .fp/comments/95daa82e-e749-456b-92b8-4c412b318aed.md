Replaced x-state with simpler state management:
- Created app/lib/agent-state/ with store, hooks, and derived state
- Removed app/machines/ folder
- Removed xstate and @xstate/react dependencies
- Updated components to use new useAgentConnection hook
- Uses useSyncExternalStore for React integration
