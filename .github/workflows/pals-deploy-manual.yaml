# TEMPLATE NOTE: This workflow allows manual deployments via GitHub Actions UI.
# 
# To use this workflow, you need to:
# 1. Configure GitHub secrets (see .github/README.md for required secrets)
# 2. Go to Actions tab > Deploy PALS (manual) > Run workflow
# 3. Select the environment (preview or prod) you want to deploy to
#
# This provides a safe way to deploy without enabling automatic deployments.
