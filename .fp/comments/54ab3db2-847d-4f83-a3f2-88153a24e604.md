Logging infrastructure already exists in worker/lib/logger.ts with all required features:
- Environment-aware formatting (ANSI colors in dev, JSON in prod)
- Structured logging with properties
- Custom formatters for compact output
- Category-based logging with configurable levels
- Already used across 7 files in the codebase

No changes needed.
